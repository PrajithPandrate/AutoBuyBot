# BuyBot
BuyBot is an automatic shopping bot that can be used to easily shop online. Whenever checking out, all a customer needs to do is paste in their amazon link and the bot
will do the rest. This means that there is no need for the customer to type in their repetitive information (username, password, name, email address, address, city, state, 
zip code). At this stage, the only part the customer needs to fill out is the payment section. Although this follows the same procedure to code, I left it out as payment
could not be done in the demo. Not only does BuyBot help you in daily occurences, it can also help when trying to buy popular products. Many products start to run out of 
stock very quickly, and people miss the opportunity to get what they wanted. With BuyBot, they eliminate the need to slowly type in all their information and instead the 
process is quick and simple. Overall, BuyBot is a helpful bot that people can use on a daily basis whenever shopping online!
